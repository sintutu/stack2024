# stack 2024

This repo shows stack of tools I know in 2024.

At this time I'm on .NET 6 or greater. I'm only on web apis using NUnit, FluentAssertions, HttpClient, Wiremock, Docker and Kubernetes to host and run my tests. 

The idea is to mark a checkpoint here, look back at what I've learned, and identify gaps in my skills as a tester and software developer in test. 

As at 23 March 2024 I believe these are the hot things I've yet to learn: 
* Front end: Selenium, Playwright, Appium. Other notables are Robot Framework, Cypress, Jasmine.
* BDD: Cucumber, Specflow
* API: NUnit, XUnit and JUnit.
* Database: sqlserver, oracle, postgress
* AI?
* Visual Testing?
* Security: OWASP Zap, any other pen test?
* Load: NBomber, JMeter. I hate JMeter
* Languages: Javascript, Java, Python
* GitHub actions, Azure Pipelines
* Kubernetes, Helm, Docker

It's quite likely there are other things to learn. I'll need to update this readme with the things to do to get this going.
